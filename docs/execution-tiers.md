# Execution tiers: what runs where, and what it costs

Status as of 2026-08-14 (set up by Claude at Peter's direction). This is the
reference for any agent deciding *where* a Harbor task can run and *whether it
may run it*. The spend rules at the bottom are binding.

## The one-line summary

The lab can now execute **every task in frontier-bench (TB3) and Harbor-Index
except 4 GPU tasks locally**, and everything including those on Modal — but
cloud runs cost real money and are gated by `policy/standing-approvals.yaml`
(`escalate_to_human: cloud_or_remote_environment`). Nothing about local free
oracle/nop work changes.

## Machine state (verified, not aspirational)

| Component | State | Verified how |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Desktop VM | **24 GiB RAM / 16 CPUs** (23.4 GiB usable; raised from 7.7 GiB on 2026-08-14) | `docker info` after restart; compose services self-healed via `restart: unless-stopped` |
| Host | 64 GB RAM, Apple Silicon (arm64) | `sysctl hw.memsize` |
| Harbor CLI | `harbor[modal]==0.21.0` (global uv tool; version pinned during reinstall) | `harbor --version`; `modal 1.5.4` imports in the tool env |
| Modal CLI | present at `~/.local/share/uv/tools/harbor/bin/modal` | — |
| Modal token | **ABSENT — deliberately.** No `~/.modal.toml` | see spend rules |

Docker settings backup (pre-change): `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.docker/settings-store.json.bak-claude`.
Operational note: quitting Docker Desktop from a script requires
`osascript -e 'quit app "Docker Desktop"'` — quitting app "Docker" silently
does nothing and a subsequent relaunch collides with the still-running VM
("no route to host" from the backend for 10+ minutes).

## How to classify a task (mechanically, from the package)

Read `task.toml` and `environment/Dockerfile`; no execution needed:

1. `[environment] gpus >= 1` → **cloud-only**. No CUDA on Apple Silicon.
2. `memory_mb > 24576` → **cloud-only** at current VM size.
3. `FROM --platform=linux/amd64` in the Dockerfile → **local-emulated**:
   runs under QEMU (slow, occasionally flaky); prefer cloud for results that
   will be cited.
4. `memory_mb > 8192` or `[agent] timeout_sec >= 10800` (3 h) → **local-heavy**:
   runs fine locally, unsuitable for canaries/smoke suites.
5. Otherwise → **local-ok**.

## TB3 classification (frontier-bench @ `3d694e91`, 74 tasks)

| Tier | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| local-ok | 45 | fair game for local automation |
| local-heavy | 24 | local, but hours-long and/or ≥8 GB — run deliberately, never as canaries |
| local-emulated | 1 | `memcached-backdoor` (amd64 pin, 12 GB) |
| cloud-only (GPU) | 4 | `exam-pdf-eval`, `fp8-rmsnorm-gemm`, `jax-speedrun-gpu` (32 GB!), `math-eval-grader` |

The heaviest non-GPU tasks now inside local capacity: `takens-embedding-lean`
(16 GB, 8 h), `live-database-cutover` (16 GB), `medical-claims-processing`
(10 GB). The library's curated‑19 (`library/curated/README.md`) remains the
canary set; this table is about *capability*, not what should run nightly.

Harbor-Index (82 tasks distilled from 29 benchmarks) is published on Harbor
Hub with all 1,476 baseline trials; its tasks follow the same classification
rules. The exact dataset slug should be read off hub.harborframework.com
before first use — do not guess it.

## Running locally (free, unchanged)

Oracle/nop controls and verifier runs stay exactly as `AGENTS.md` prescribes:
through `evallab` wrappers, jobs under `runs/`, ≤2 concurrent. The larger VM
just means `local-heavy` tasks no longer fail on memory.

## Running on Modal (binding rules)

**Any cloud/remote execution is `escalate_to_human` per
`policy/standing-approvals.yaml`. This includes oracle-only sweeps** — they
skip model APIs but still bill Modal compute (CPU/GPU-hours). Concretely:

- Agents must NOT create or restore a Modal token. Token absence is the
  enforcement mechanism, not an oversight: without `~/.modal.toml`,
  `--env modal` fails before anything can bill.
- When Peter approves cloud work, he creates the token himself
  (`~/.local/share/uv/tools/harbor/bin/modal setup`, browser auth) and the
  approved job runs through the queue like anything else.
- First run of any new suite is `-n 1` to price it before `-n 5`.

Reference commands (for the approved case — copied from frontier-bench README):

```bash
harbor run -d frontier-bench/frontier-bench -n 1 --agent oracle \
  --n-concurrent 100 --env modal          # price-discovery pass
harbor run -d frontier-bench/frontier-bench -n 5 --agent oracle \
  --n-concurrent 500 --env modal          # full validation sweep
```

## What agents should take from this

- Before running any task, classify it with the five rules above; never start
  a `local-heavy`/`cloud-only` task as if it were a canary.
- `--env modal` (or any non-docker `--env`) without an explicit, current
  approval from Peter is a policy violation even at $0.01.
- If a task fails locally with an OOM or platform error, check its tier before
  filing it as a task bug.
